Hey! I’m Bradley, and this is my take on the Cloud Resume Challenge. I built this project in just one week — fast-paced, challenging, but incredibly rewarding.

I used this challenge to bring together everything I’ve been learning in cloud architecture and DevOps, especially during my Solutions Architect Apprenticeship and recent DevOps placement. Along the way, I added my own spin: a "Rate My Website" form, a visitor counter, and full CI/CD automation — all running in the cloud, fully serverless, and cost-effective.

🔧 What I Built
Here’s a quick breakdown of what’s under the hood:

Frontend: Static website with custom HTML, CSS & JavaScript (80% of the code is mine!)

Hosting: Amazon S3 (London region), with CloudFront for global delivery

Domain: bradpearce.com managed via Route 53

Security: HTTPS with AWS Certificate Manager

Backend: AWS Lambda + API Gateway for handling form submissions

Database: DynamoDB to store ratings

CI/CD: GitHub Actions automating deployments from a private repo

Monitoring: CloudWatch alarms to keep an eye on costs

🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me practice and refine:

Building real-world cloud infrastructure from scratch

Writing serverless functions with AWS Lambda

Deploying with CI/CD via GitHub Actions

Working with DynamoDB and API Gateway

Managing costs and using AWS Free Tier smartly

Keeping things secure (SSL, encryption, etc.)

🗂️ Key Features
✅ Custom “Rate My Website” form (1–10 rating scale)

✅ Live visitor counter

✅ Automated deployments with GitHub Actions

✅ Full stack built in the AWS London region (eu-west-2) for UK-based performance and compliance

✅ Serverless, scalable, and affordable (close to £0/month!)
